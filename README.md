# Portfolio Return Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation in R to find portfolio returns.


This script allows us to compare the return distribution of an ETF that replicates the S&P500 with that achieved by investing in a portfolio of at least three stocks. 
This script is a simple version of the Shiny application available at:

Please refer to the pdf file for more details on the application's work and examples.
